# Historical Context

ROT13 was originally used by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC.

ROT13 is not used as an encryption scheme, as it does not encrypt.

> In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov [demonstrated](https://www.zdnet.com/news/dimitry-sklyarov-enemy-or-friend/116424) that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme.
