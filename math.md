# ROT13-Cipher
## Mathematical Analysis

### How many possible keys or codes could there be?
A ROT13 is a more simplified version of a Caesar Cipher. You can break it with 25 keys. If you did 26 your letter would end up where it started, and if it was 27 keys it would be the same as 1. So it has the same number of keys that the Caesar Cipher has.

### How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key. What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
ROT13 is often described as one of the easiest codes to decrpyt, especially if you know its key. If you are given a string of random letters, and are told its in ROT13, all you have to do is shift them 13 places and you have solved it. A Caesar cipher would require you to find out how much it shifts, a ROT13 is always 13 places; its in the name. I'd say that the mathematical complexity to solve the code is quite small, but you would still need some to identify something as ROT13.
