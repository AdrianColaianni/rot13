<h1>Final Analysis</h1>

<h6>Why did this stop being a useful code?</h6>

The ROT13 is a form of Caeser cipher. The Caeser cipher can be broken by trying out all 25 keys, whereas the ROT13 cipher can be broken by just shifting the letters 13 places. Therefore it's not useful because it is not secure, it doesn't involve any complicated  math and can even be figured out in your head.

<h6>What made it useful when it was being used?</h6>

ROT13 was used in online forums for hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive material online. ROT13 has been described as the "Equivalent of a magazine printing the answer to a quiz upside down", because of how easy it is to decrypt.

<h6>What are other interesting uses of this code?</h6>

One interesting use of ROT13 is that it has inspired a variety of letter and word games online.
