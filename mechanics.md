### How does the cipher work?
The ROT13 cipher is a substitution cipher with a specific key where the letters of the alphabet are offset 13 places. 
All A's are replaced with N's, and all B's are replaced with O's, and so on. It can also be thought of as a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.

### Demo an encryption and decryption is it symmetric?
If you were to encrypt the message "CYBER SECURITY" it would end up as "PLORE FRPHEVGL" because you shift each of the letters 13 places in the alphabet. 
The decription is the same process you shift the letters 13 spaces. "PLORE FRPHEVGL" would look like "CYBER SECURITY"
This cipher is symetric because the encryption and the decryption are the same process.
